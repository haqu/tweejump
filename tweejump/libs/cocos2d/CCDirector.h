/**Class that creates and handle the main Window and manages how
and when to execute the Scenes.
 
 The CCDirector is also resposible for:
  - initializing the OpenGL ES context
  - setting the OpenGL pixel format (default on is RGB565)
  - setting the OpenGL buffer depth (default one is 0-bit)
  - setting the projection (default one is 3D)
  - setting the orientation (default one is Protrait)
 
 Since the CCDirector is a singleton, the standard way to use it is by calling:
  - [[CCDirector sharedDirector] methodName];
 
 The CCDirector also sets the default OpenGL context:
  - GL_TEXTURE_2D is enabled
  - GL_VERTEX_ARRAY is enabled
  - GL_COLOR_ARRAY is enabled
  - GL_TEXTURE_COORD_ARRAY is enabled
