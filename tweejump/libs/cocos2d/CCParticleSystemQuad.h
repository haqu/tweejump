/** CCParticleSystemQuad is a subclass of CCParticleSystem

 It includes all the features of ParticleSystem.
 
 Special features and Limitations:	
  - Particle size can be any float number.
  - The system can be scaled
  - The particles can be rotated
  - On 1st and 2nd gen iPhones: It is only a bit slower that CCParticleSystemPoint
  - On 3rd gen iPhone and iPads: It is MUCH faster than CCParticleSystemPoint
  - It consumes more RAM and more GPU memory than CCParticleSystemPoint
  - It supports subrects
